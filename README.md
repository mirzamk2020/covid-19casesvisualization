Project: Global COVID-19 cases visualization
URL: https://trinket.io/library/trinkets/b05765a5fc

Description: In this project, I used urllib.request, json, and pygal modules to create charting
that demonstrates the COVID-19 confirmed cases and recovered by date with a line chart and COVID-19
confirmed cases and recovered by country with a pie chart of top 'x' countries in the world.
I utilized the data from github that transformed into json file. The data originally came from
the data repository for the 2019 Novel Coronavirus Visual Dashboard operated 
by the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering.
